Delaware 19709:<\/p>Who was Contacted: Foreclosure Attorney <br>Contacted Date: 09\/09\/2020 <br>Action Plan: Other<br>Comment: The case is fully teed up for attorney to file the writs to schedule the property for sheriff\u2019s sale. The delay is that the sheriff has not resumed sheriff\u2019s sales due to the virus. The building where they are conducted is closed to the public. Attorney spoke to the chief deputy today and was informed that they have  filed a petition with the court to conduct sheriff\u2019s sales by ZOOM but there is no telling now if the court will allow it or even when the court will make a decision one way or the other on the petition. Bottom line is we are in an indefinite holding pattern on getting the foreclosure sale schedule. Attorney will continue to monitor the situation and will advise of any developments.<br><p>This notification is to let you know the most recent activity related to this file.

He has maintained constant communication with Sharestates and has communicated he will be able to bring his loans current by September through the following strategies:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Stabilizing revenue streams\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ol type='a'>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Rental income: Florio keeps a portfolio of rental properties in the Paterson, New Jersey area. New Jersey has banned evictions until the month of August, leading to drops in rent payments from tenants (70% in April, 55% in May). The borrower feels that these percentages will begin climbing to their regular percentages as tenants are able to return to work.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Construction: A partial shutdown in New Jersey paused some of Florio\u2019s construction projects. The construction ban is being lifted and these projects are continuing.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Property disposition: COVID-19 led to reduced activity in the capital markets, inhibiting Florio\u2019s ability to capture equity in his properties through sale or refinance. Lenders are becoming active again and will create refi opportunities for Florio to exit out of his loans with Sharestates.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/ol>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Sale of Properties\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ol type='a'>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Florio is reviewing smaller assets in his portfolio (no liens) to sell and already has contracts in place for transactions in June and July.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/ol>  \n\t\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Accessing Equity\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ol type='a'>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Florio is sourcing equity by partnering with the Carlton Group (https:\/\/carltongroup.com\/) to package individual residential units together as complete investment assets.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/ol> \n\t\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Federal Loan\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ol type='a'>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Through the Main Street Lending Program, Florio aims to secure a federal loan of up to $20M.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/ol> \n\t\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\n\t\t\t\t<\/ol> \n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<br><p>This notification is to let you know the most recent activity related to this file.

He has maintained constant communication with Sharestates and has communicated he will be able to bring his loans current by September through the following strategies:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Stabilizing revenue streams\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ol type='a'>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Rental income: Florio keeps a portfolio of rental properties in the Paterson, New Jersey area. New Jersey has banned evictions until the month of August, leading to drops in rent payments from tenants (70% in April, 55% in May). The borrower feels that these percentages will begin climbing to their regular percentages as tenants are able to return to work.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Construction: A partial shutdown in New Jersey paused some of Florio\u2019s construction projects. The construction ban is being lifted and these projects are continuing.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Property disposition: COVID-19 led to reduced activity in the capital markets, inhibiting Florio\u2019s ability to capture equity in his properties through sale or refinance. Lenders are becoming active again and will create refi opportunities for Florio to exit out of his loans with Sharestates.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/ol>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Sale of Properties\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ol type='a'>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Florio is reviewing smaller assets in his portfolio (no liens) to sell and already has contracts in place for transactions in June and July.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/ol>  \n\t\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Accessing Equity\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ol type='a'>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Florio is sourcing equity by partnering with the Carlton Group (https:\/\/carltongroup.com\/) to package individual residential units together as complete investment assets.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/ol> \n\t\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Federal Loan\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ol type='a'>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Through the Main Street Lending Program, Florio aims to secure a federal loan of up to $20M.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/ol> \n\t\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\n\t\t\t\t<\/ol> \n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<br><p>This notification is to let you know the most recent activity related to this file.

He has maintained constant communication with Sharestates and has communicated he will be able to bring his loans current by September through the following strategies:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Stabilizing revenue streams\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ol type='a'>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Rental income: Florio keeps a portfolio of rental properties in the Paterson, New Jersey area. New Jersey has banned evictions until the month of August, leading to drops in rent payments from tenants (70% in April, 55% in May). The borrower feels that these percentages will begin climbing to their regular percentages as tenants are able to return to work.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Construction: A partial shutdown in New Jersey paused some of Florio\u2019s construction projects. The construction ban is being lifted and these projects are continuing.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Property disposition: COVID-19 led to reduced activity in the capital markets, inhibiting Florio\u2019s ability to capture equity in his properties through sale or refinance. Lenders are becoming active again and will create refi opportunities for Florio to exit out of his loans with Sharestates.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/ol>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Sale of Properties\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ol type='a'>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Florio is reviewing smaller assets in his portfolio (no liens) to sell and already has contracts in place for transactions in June and July.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/ol>  \n\t\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Accessing Equity\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ol type='a'>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Florio is sourcing equity by partnering with the Carlton Group (https:\/\/carltongroup.com\/) to package individual residential units together as complete investment assets.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/ol> \n\t\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Federal Loan\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ol type='a'>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Through the Main Street Lending Program, Florio aims to secure a federal loan of up to $20M.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/ol> \n\t\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\n\t\t\t\t<\/ol> \n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<br><p>This notification is to let you know the most recent activity related to this file.

He has maintained constant communication with Sharestates and has communicated he will be able to bring his loans current by September through the following strategies:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Stabilizing revenue streams\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ol type='a'>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Rental income: Florio keeps a portfolio of rental properties in the Paterson, New Jersey area. New Jersey has banned evictions until the month of August, leading to drops in rent payments from tenants (70% in April, 55% in May). The borrower feels that these percentages will begin climbing to their regular percentages as tenants are able to return to work.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Construction: A partial shutdown in New Jersey paused some of Florio\u2019s construction projects. The construction ban is being lifted and these projects are continuing.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Property disposition: COVID-19 led to reduced activity in the capital markets, inhibiting Florio\u2019s ability to capture equity in his properties through sale or refinance. Lenders are becoming active again and will create refi opportunities for Florio to exit out of his loans with Sharestates.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/ol>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Sale of Properties\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ol type='a'>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Florio is reviewing smaller assets in his portfolio (no liens) to sell and already has contracts in place for transactions in June and July.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/ol>  \n\t\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Accessing Equity\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ol type='a'>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Florio is sourcing equity by partnering with the Carlton Group (https:\/\/carltongroup.com\/) to package individual residential units together as complete investment assets.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/ol> \n\t\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Federal Loan\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ol type='a'>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Through the Main Street Lending Program, Florio aims to secure a federal loan of up to $20M.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/ol> \n\t\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\n\t\t\t\t<\/ol> \n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<br><p>This notification is to let you know the most recent activity related to this file.

You will soon receive a notification that the loan status has been changed to foreclosure.\n\nAs of this past Wednesday, the foreclosure attorney has filed default judgement motions. The foreclosure attorney will next serve the judgements to the borrower. Once the borrower\u2019s attorney signs the service to acknowledge receipt, there will be a 30-day period for the borrower to petition to strike\/ open the judgement.\n\nIf there is no petition by the borrower in the 30-day period, the foreclosure attorney may obtain a writ of execution to schedule a sheriff\u2019s sale. Please note that there has been a moratorium on sheriff\u2019s sales in Pennsylvania due to the pandemic, leading to postponement.\n\nIf the borrower petitions the judgement, then the process will take more time to allow the foreclosure attorney to respond and the courts to make a ruling.\n\nSharestates will continue to communicate with the borrower regarding any work-out solutions that bring this loan current or pay it off.

He has maintained constant communication with Sharestates and has communicated he will be able to bring his loans current by September through the following strategies:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Stabilizing revenue streams\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ol type='a'>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Rental income: Florio keeps a portfolio of rental properties in the Paterson, New Jersey area. New Jersey has banned evictions until the month of August, leading to drops in rent payments from tenants (70% in April, 55% in May). The borrower feels that these percentages will begin climbing to their regular percentages as tenants are able to return to work.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Construction: A partial shutdown in New Jersey paused some of Florio\u2019s construction projects. The construction ban is being lifted and these projects are continuing.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Property disposition: COVID-19 led to reduced activity in the capital markets, inhibiting Florio\u2019s ability to capture equity in his properties through sale or refinance. Lenders are becoming active again and will create refi opportunities for Florio to exit out of his loans with Sharestates.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/ol>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Sale of Properties\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ol type='a'>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Florio is reviewing smaller assets in his portfolio (no liens) to sell and already has contracts in place for transactions in June and July.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/ol>  \n\t\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Accessing Equity\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ol type='a'>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Florio is sourcing equity by partnering with the Carlton Group (https:\/\/carltongroup.com\/) to package individual residential units together as complete investment assets.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/ol> \n\t\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Federal Loan\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ol type='a'>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Through the Main Street Lending Program, Florio aims to secure a federal loan of up to $20M.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/ol> \n\t\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\n\t\t\t\t<\/ol> \n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<br><p>This notification is to let you know the most recent activity related to this file.

I have taken a loan from this company and my loan number is BC2019-009083. Last week I went to collect rent from my tenants from 107-05 liberty avenue LLC, and no one was able to pay the rent because they have not been able to go to work for the past two weeks. Also in this Liberty building there is retail store and they are not able to open the store because of the corona virus. I am not able to fight because the government has said us landowners cannot remove any tenant for 90 days. I am a diabetic patient and I cannot take this much stress. I request to get a mortgate extension. In the month of April I wont be able to pay mortgage. Please call me if you have any questions or concerns. \n\nThank You \nVijay Sharma \n646-704-6946\n <\/li><\/ul><p>Please feel free to look at our current loans open for investment.

He has maintained constant communication with Sharestates and has communicated he will be able to bring his loans current by September through the following strategies:<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<ol>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Stabilizing revenue streams\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ol type='a'>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Rental income: Florio keeps a portfolio of rental properties in the Paterson, New Jersey area. New Jersey has banned evictions until the month of August, leading to drops in rent payments from tenants (70% in April, 55% in May). The borrower feels that these percentages will begin climbing to their regular percentages as tenants are able to return to work.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Construction: A partial shutdown in New Jersey paused some of Florio\u2019s construction projects. The construction ban is being lifted and these projects are continuing.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Property disposition: COVID-19 led to reduced activity in the capital markets, inhibiting Florio\u2019s ability to capture equity in his properties through sale or refinance. Lenders are becoming active again and will create refi opportunities for Florio to exit out of his loans with Sharestates.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/ol>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Sale of Properties\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ol type='a'>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Florio is reviewing smaller assets in his portfolio (no liens) to sell and already has contracts in place for transactions in June and July.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/ol>  \n\t\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Accessing Equity\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ol type='a'>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Florio is sourcing equity by partnering with the Carlton Group (https:\/\/carltongroup.com\/) to package individual residential units together as complete investment assets.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/ol> \n\t\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>Federal Loan\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<ol type='a'>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<li>Through the Main Street Lending Program, Florio aims to secure a federal loan of up to $20M.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/ol> \n\t\t\t\t\t<\/li>\n\n\t\t\t\t<\/ol> \n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<br><p>This notification is to let you know the most recent activity related to this file.
